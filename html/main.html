        <p style="font-size:20px">The first workshop on Software and Hardware Co-design of Deep Learning Systems on Accelerators (SHDA) will be held in conjunction with Supercomputing Conference 2023 in the Colorado Convention Center, Denver, Colorado on Sunday, November, 12th, 2023.  ( https://sc23.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=wksp159&sess=sess149 )</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning systems and applications have become a driving force in multiple transdisciplinary domains. This evolution has been supported by the rapid improvements of advanced accelerators, such as GPU, FPGA, and CGRA. However, existing research is focused on hardware accelerators, deep learning systems and applications separately, but the co-design among them are largely underexplored. To develop high-performance deep learning systems on advanced accelerators, our workshop will focus on the following three important topics: (i) adaptive deep learning model exploration and training for target inference devices based on customized user demands, (ii) joint optimization of deep learning model design and accelerator architecture/compiler design, and (iii) When new computational functionalities have been made available by advanced accelerators, those up-to-date techniques need to be leveraged by both accelerator users and contributors for deep learning system and application optimization.</p>
