        <p style="font-size:20px">3rd Workshop on Software and Hardware Co-design of Deep Learning Systems in Future Architectures (SHDA) in Conjunction with <a href="https://www.sca-hpcasia2026.jp/" target="_blank"> SCA/HPCAsia 2026 </a> in Osaka, Japan on January 26, 2026.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning systems and applications have become a driving force in multiple transdisciplinary domains. This evolution has been supported by the rapid improvements of advanced processor, accelerator, memory, storage, interconnect and system architectures, including architectures based on future and emerging hardware (e.g., quantum, superconducting, photonic, neuromorphic). However, existing research is focused on hardware accelerators, deep learning systems and applications separately, but the co-design among them is largely underexplored. To develop high-performance deep learning systems on advanced accelerators, our workshop will focus on the following three important topics: </p>    
        <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>adaptive deep learning model exploration and training for target inference devices based on customized user demands, </li>
            <li>joint optimization of deep learning model design with future accelerator architecture/compiler design, and </li>
            <li>how to leverage state-of-the-art computational functionalities from advanced accelerators for application optimization. </li>
        </ul>

		<i> Future Accelerator Co-Design and Prototyping with Open-Source Tools </i>
		As transistor scaling slows and data rates from scientific instruments increase, data movement has become a primary performance and energy bottleneck in modern computing systems. Addressing this challenge increasingly requires on-chip data reduction, dataflow-oriented designs, and specialized accelerators, particularly for inference and real-time processing near the data source. This talk discusses future accelerator co-design from a system and prototyping perspective, using inference-centric accelerator designs for X-ray detector systems as illustrative examples. It highlights how open-source tools such as Chisel, Verilator, cocotb, and FireSim, together with open standards like RISC-V, can lower the barrier to hardware–software co-design and enable faster exploration of application-driven accelerator architectures.

		<i> A Unidirectional Two-Compartment Neuron Circuit with On-chip STDP learning </i>
		<br/>
		Most neuromorphic chips implement the single-compartment point neuron model where synapse circuits connect directly to a leaky integrate and fire (LIF) soma circuit. However, when using a biologically plausible soma circuit (e.g., Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model), an interface circuitry, such as a current conveyor circuit, is needed to transmit synaptic current to the soma circuit. This is especially true for ultra-low power neuron circuits, where membrane capacitance is on the order of 20 fF. This necessity arises because the parasitic capacitance and leakage current caused by fabrication mismatch and second-order effects of the output transistors in the synapse circuits can disturb the spiking dynamics of the soma circuit if connected without an interface. Using an interface circuit to isolate soma's membrane capacitor from synapses resolves this issue. We propose to use a unidirectional resistor (a transconductance circuit) to connect the synapse and soma circuits instead of conventional current conveyor circuits. Using a biologically plausible spike pattern detection model, we show that the on-chip STDP learning performance of the proposed unidirectional two-compartment neuron circuit is similar to a single-compartment circuit (with a current conveyor as an interface) and additionally, it is more power-efficient and biologically plausible. The chip is fabricated in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 250 nm technology node and comprises a single neuron circuit.

		<i> Automated Approaches for Quantum Software-Hardware Co Design </i>
		<br/>
		The rapid diversification of quantum hardware platforms and software toolchains has made quantum computing an increasingly heterogeneous ecosystem-one in which effective software-hardware co design is both essential and still largely unexplored. In this talk, I will discuss our recent efforts within the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) to build automated, data driven workflows that help navigate this complexity and illuminate what meaningful co design might look like for quantum systems. I will highlight two complementary directions: the MQT Predictor, which uses reinforcement learning and supervised machine learning to automatically select suitable quantum devices and construct optimized compiler flows; and our compiler and hardware modeling work for neutral atom architectures, where close collaboration with experimentalists enables systematic exploration of architectural choices and routing strategies. Together, these efforts illustrate emerging principles for quantum software-hardware co design—automation, hardware aware abstractions, and learned guidance—and point toward open questions on how deep learning can further support quantum workflow optimization across diverse quantum technologies.

		<i> Towards Unified AI and HPC Accelerators: Design and Optimization of RIKEN CGRA </i>
		<br/>
		Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) are promising post-Moore accelerators for scaling performance in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, fully understanding and realizing the benefits CGRAs bring to these demanding workloads is an open research question. This presentation highlights our past and future design-space explorations to optimize our CGRA architecture specifically for HPC and AI applications.
