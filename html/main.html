        <p style="font-size:20px">3rd Workshop on Software and Hardware Co-design of Deep Learning Systems in Future Architectures (SHDA) in Conjunction with <a href="https://www.sca-hpcasia2026.jp/" target="_blank"> SCA/HPCAsia 2026 </a> in Osaka, Japan on January 26, 2026.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning systems and applications have become a driving force in multiple transdisciplinary domains. This evolution has been supported by the rapid improvements of advanced processor, accelerator, memory, storage, interconnect and system architectures, including architectures based on future and emerging hardware (e.g., quantum, superconducting, photonic, neuromorphic). However, existing research is focused on hardware accelerators, deep learning systems and applications separately, but the co-design among them is largely underexplored. To develop high-performance deep learning systems on advanced accelerators, our workshop will focus on the following three important topics: </p>    
        <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>adaptive deep learning model exploration and training for target inference devices based on customized user demands, </li>
            <li>joint optimization of deep learning model design with future accelerator architecture/compiler design, and </li>
            <li>how to leverage state-of-the-art computational functionalities from advanced accelerators for application optimization. </li>
        </ul>
