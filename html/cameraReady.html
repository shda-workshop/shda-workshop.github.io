        <h2>Instructions for Authors</h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px">The detailed SC23 Workshop proceedings instructions for authors of SC23 workshop accepted papers are described <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WgMWbfcsMIwxBTO4LuZzcYZTN0kkB-DphbPZDeV5fY8/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">For the final version of the workshop papers, authors will be required to provide all source files plus camera ready PDF.</p>
        <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>By September 15th 2023, authors will receive an email directly from the ACMâ€™s rights review system with full instructions for accessing the system and completing the online form.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the form is completed in all its parts. In particular, the form needs to have the final paper title and list the authors exactly as they will appear in the final paper (names and affiliations). ACM requires that all authors listed on a paper have a valid ORCID.</li>
            <li>After submitting the rights form, authors should receive a link by email from tapsadmin@aptaracorp.awsapps.com to submit the final manuscript.</li>
            <li>TAPS workflow in preparing the final documents: <a href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow" target="_blank">https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow</a></li>
            <li>The final version of the workshop papers must be uploaded using The ACM Publishing System (TAPS). Also, the presenter and final paper metadata (title, authors, speaker, and abstract) is uploaded to the ACM TAPS submissions website.</li>
            <li>Authors should use that link to upload the zip file of their paper for processing. The instructions regarding how to prepare your zip file for submission are posted at the top of the page (loaded after clicking the link). Authors should make sure to verify their paper details from the option "CHECK PAPER DETAILS" provided at the mentioned link, before they upload the zip file, as that information will be printed in their paper's HTML version.
In addition, any supplements/videos associated with their paper will need to be uploaded using a separate link mentioned in the same mail from ACM.
Should the authors have any questions or issues preparing or uploading the zip file for their paper, please contact confsupport@aptaracorp.com or tapssupport@aptaracorp.com for assistance.</li>
            <li>The final paper metadata (title, authors, presenter, and abstract) and manuscript also need to be uploaded using the SC Submissions website <a href="https://submissions.supercomputing.org" target="_blank">https://submissions.supercomputing.org</a>.</li>
            <li>SC will publish the accepted workshop papers in Workshops Proceedings as a separate volume from the Technical Papers Proceedings.</li>
            <li>Paper submission must use the new ACM proceedings templates at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a> . For Latex users, version 1.90 (last update April 4, 2023) is the latest template, and please use the "sigconf" option.</li>
            <li>Regular papers are limited to 8 pages (not counting references) plus an optional 2 page AD appendix (10 pages in total).</li>
            <li>Short papers are 4 pages, including references and figures. (The title of a short paper begins with "Short Paper: ".)</li>
            <li>SHDA encourages regular paper submissions to provide artifact description and evaluation of no more than 2 additional pages (i.e. all of a regular paper is up to a total of 12 pages).  Details are shown in <a href="https://sc23.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative" target="_blank">https://sc23.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative</a> .</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:20px">If your paper is accepted, at least one author must register for ACM/IEEE SC Workshop 2023 in-person attendance by September 29, 2023, in order to attend the SC Workshop SHDA 2023 and present the paper. Register <a href="https://sc23.supercomputing.org/attend/registration" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, one author has to present the paper at SC Workshop SHDA 2023 in person.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">All presenters for this submission must fill out the <a href="https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=VideoConsentandReleaseForm&site=sc23" target="_blank">Video Consent and Release Form</a>.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">SC23 requires the use of the SC23 slide template for the title slide of each presentation. This is for branding when files are uploaded to the digital library.</p>
