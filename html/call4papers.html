        <p style="font-size:20px">Emerging are advanced accelerators oriented for speeding up deep learning systems, while scientific domains raise the customized demands on system performance of deep learning applications. To fully utilize the new features of state-of-the-art hardware accelerators and meet the diverse demands from scientific domains, the increasing demands on software and hardware co-design pose major challenges for deep learning systems. This requires new research and software tools that can further deliver higher performance and resource efficiency of deep learning systems, taking advantage of new architectures and hardware available on next generation accelerators. This international workshop will be focused on a promising research field â€” software and hardware co-design of deep learning systems on accelerators, and provide a platform for researchers to show their preliminary results, inspire ideas, explore novel directions, promote collaborations, and enlarge the community. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>Data parallelism and model parallelism</li>
            <li>Automating Parallelism</li>
            <li>Performance modeling of deep learning applications</li>
            <li>Scalable optimization methods for deep learning</li>
            <li>Scalable hyper-parameter optimization</li>
            <li>Hardware-aware neural architecture search</li>
            <li>Testing, debugging, and profiling deep learning systems</li>
            <li>Hardware-efficient training and inference</li>
            <li>Efficient hardware accelerators for deep learning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a name="Submissions">Submission Guildlines</a></h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px">Papers should be submitted electronically via the SC submission system
( https://submissions.supercomputing.org/ )</p>
        <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>Submitted papers will be evaluated by at least three reviewers and the accepted papers will be published in a proceeding as an SC23 volume.</li>
            <li>Paper submission must use the new ACM proceedings templates at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template . For Latex users, version 1.90 (last update April 4, 2023) is the latest template, and please use the "sigconf" option.</li>
            <li>SHDA will accept regular papers of 8 pages and short papers of 4 pages, including the references and figures.</li>
            <li>SHDA encourages regular paper submissions to provide artifact description and evaluation of no more than 4 additional pages (i.e. all of a regular paper is up to a total of 12 pages).  Detailsare shown in https://sc23.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative/</li>
