        <p style="font-size:20px">This international workshop is on the software and hardware co-design of deep learning systems on accelerators. To efficiently deploy the state-of-the-art hardware accelerators to meet the diverse demands from scientific domains, software-hardware co-design has become a critical research issue. Our workshop will highlight the latest research and software tools that can deliver higher performance and resource efficiency of deep learning systems, by taking advantage of new architectures and hardware available on the next generation accelerators. Through this workshop, we will provide a platform for researchers to showcase their preliminary results, inspire ideas, explore novel directions, promote collaborations, and enlarge the community. Topics include, but are not limited to: </p>
        <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>Performance modeling of deep learning applications, </li>
            <li>Scalable hyper-parameter optimization, </li>
            <li>Hardware-aware neural architecture search, </li>
            <li>Testing, debugging, and profiling deep learning systems in accelerators, </li>
            <li>Hardware-efficient training and inference, </li>
            <li>Scalability of large language models, </li>
            <li>Automating parallelism for deep learning systems, </li>
            <li>Efficient accelerators for deep learning, </li>
            <li>Neuromorphic computing, </li>
            <li>Emerging memory technologies for deep learning, </li>
            <li>Quantum machine learning.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-size:20px">The organizers will review manuscripts and invite authors of accepted manuscripts to give a 20 minute presentation at this half-day workshop. All accepted papers will be published in an ACM-affiliated proceedings publication. If you are interested to submit, please follow the guidelines below. </p>

        <h2><a name="Submissions">Submission Guidelines</a></h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px">Manuscripts should be submitted electronically via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=shda2026" target="_blank">EasyChair</a>.</p>
        <ul style="font-size:20px">
            <li>All authors should submit manuscripts for review in a single-column format. Manuscripts must be a minimum of 12 pages and at most 18 pages in PDF format including figures and references, formatted according to the ACM Proceedings Style. The ACM templates for Word and LaTeX are shown below. Also, ACM has partnered with Overleaf and the ACM LaTeX template on Overleaf platform is available. Please follow STEP 1 (Microsoft Word/LaTeX) at in <a ref="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions" target="_blank"> 2. Workflow and Templates </a>. Please note that there are two different instructions for Word and LaTeX template users.
            <li>Each manuscript will have at least three reviewers. The program committee will execute a fair and uniform selection process based on the novelty and quality of the submission and within the scope of the workshop. The peer review process is single-blind. Reviewers have access to the names of paper submitters.</li>
